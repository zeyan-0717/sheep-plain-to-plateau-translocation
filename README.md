# Comprehensive time-series transcriptome atlas in response to hypoxia

## 1. Introduction
High-altitude hypoxia acclimatization requires whole-body physiological regulation in highland immigrants, but the underlying genetic mechanism has not been clarified. Here we used sheep as an animal model for plain-to-plateau translocationplantation. We generated multi-omics data including **59 WGS, 1,277 time-resolved bulk RNA-Seq, 66 ATAC-Seq and 6 single-cell RNA-Seq datasets** from multiple tissues as well as **phenotypic data from 20 bio-indicators**. We characterized transcriptional changes of all genes in each tissue, and examined multi-tissue temporal dynamics and transcriptional interactions among genes. In particular, we identified critical functional genes regulating the short response to hypoxia in each tissue. We further identified TAD-constrained cis-regulatory elements, which suppressed the transcriptional activity of most genes under hypoxia. Phenotypic and transcriptional evidence indicated that antenatal hypoxia could improve hypoxia tolerance in offspring. Furthermore, we provided time-series expression data of candidate genes associated with human mountain sickness and high-altitude adaptation.**Our study provides valuable resources and insights for future hypoxia-related studies in mammals**.
